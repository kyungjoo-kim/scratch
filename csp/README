0. Load modules (you can use mine from $HOME/bin/white.sh.

. $HOME/bin/white.sh

1. Kokkos and KokkosKernels are installed and provided from Kyungjoo's directory for Sandia testbeds.

2. To build a test driver, 
 - testing with MAGMA, you don't have to change anything in Makefile just type 
   make this 

 - MAGMA does not have a batched eigensolver and it takes long time in testing. if you would like to 
   exclude MAGMA testing
   make this TEST_MAGMA=FALSE
  
3. Test with jacobian matrices

 - allocate a node 
   white Pascal node: bsub -Is -q rhel7G bash
 
 - testing random matrix test
   ./main-csp.exe -N 1000 -B 10

 - testing jacobian matrices from a file
   ./main-csp.exe -F data/h2/jac.out

 - testing jacobian matrices with a batchsize
   ./main-csp.exe -F data/h2/jac.out -N 10000
